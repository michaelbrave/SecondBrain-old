# Note-Taking
Status: #Idea
Tags: #NoteTaking 

Based on [[Evergreen Notes Method]] and the [[Zettelkasten Method]], this has some relation to [[Digital Gardens]] and [[Link Your Thinking Method]]

The core ideas are to:
- Keep it simple, ease of use and actually using are paramount
- Make each note as atomic as possible
- Use a flat hierarchy with an emphasis on connections to allow for new insights to form
- Write your own words, of if you quote or reference something add your own insights and connection to that

Honestly the rest is just tweaks on the how and the why of it, but the core of this is what matters most. [[Actually Doing]] is worth more than any amount of fiddling for [[pre-optimized efficiency]]. 

In essence note taking is note one but 2-3 separate problems
1. getting it down
2. refining, editing and polishing
3. review, memorization or idea prompting
