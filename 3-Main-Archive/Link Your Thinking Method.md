# MOC/LYT - Linking Your Thinking
Status: #Idea
Tags:

Similar in practice to [[Zettelkasten Method]] and the [[Evergreen Notes Method]] 

the method advocates that:
	_Your digital library should:_

	1.  Be a joy to use
	2.  Be future-proofed (so your notes are robust, not fragile)
	3.  Allow for fast and reliable note retrieval (both today and in 10 years)
	4.  Encourage critical, creative, connective, and generative thinking
	5.  Encourage active, engaged, and contextual thinking
	6.  Encourage lateral and metaphorical thinking
	7.  Allow for the spontaneous cross-pollination of ideas
	8.  Produce finished products (when desired)
	9.  Accumulate in meaningful knowledge over time
	10.  Compound in personal value over time
	11.  Encourage repetition (repetitions strengthen memory)

It's a framework that overlays on top of [[Zettelkasten Method]] 

this seems to be where the main idea for [[Map of Content]] (MOC) comes from.

Is an MOC the same as a structure node? - more or less but the purpose is more to show connections between notes

instead of a top down or bottom up, it's a middle outward system, but it's flexible.
