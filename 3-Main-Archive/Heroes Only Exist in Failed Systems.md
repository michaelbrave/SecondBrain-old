# Heroes Only Exist in Failed Systems
Status: #Idea
Tags: #Heroes #Systems

If we get to a point where heroes are asked for, called on, expected or needed, it means that many points of failure have already occurred. 

Most of the time they expect these heroes to sacrifice themselves for others, I think this is disgusting, not the heroes who rise to the challenge (but we have to ask if they should have) but those asking that of them in the first place.
