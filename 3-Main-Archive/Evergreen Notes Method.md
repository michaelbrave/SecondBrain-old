# Evergreen Notes Method
Status: #Idea
Tags:

a deviation of [[Zettelkasten Method]] made by [[Andy Mutuschak]]. 

One's notes should follow the following principles:
1. Atomic - the smallest unit possible
2. Concept Oriented - grouped by what it's about not where it comes from
3. Densely linked - the connections are the real value
4. Associatively Organized rather than Hierarchical - to better form connections
5. Written for Self - writing is to help you learn, not to show off, this is the rough draft brainstorming zone

Some concepts added by [[Andy Mutuschak]] but aren't actually at odds with Zettelkasten:
- Serendipity Encouraging - find things as you go, be surprised
- Growth over time - building up something
- Use one's own words - written in your own words or adding a comment of understanding to what has already been said. 

Ideas of execution emphasized by [[Andy Mutuschak]]:
- Inbox for new notes
- morning writing practice
- making notes public
- taxonomy of note types
- titles that act as abstraction for the note
- contextual backlinks

Types of Notes:
- Scratch notes
- Prompts and Incomplete Notes
- Evergreen Notes - same as zettels
- Outline Notes - aka structure or hub notes
- Literature Notes - I've decided to change it to Reference Notes as it's not all reading, it's closer to media and even that doesn't capture it as there are classes, talks, meetings etc
- Person Notes - it's good to keep a list of people you reference, but I see this as another kind of reference note
- Log Notes - I believe this is the same as Dailies
