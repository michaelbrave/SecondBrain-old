finalizing the meeting notes from the previous meeting (ie: Everyone agrees that the stated meeting notes are correct)

"every meeting needs an official record/minutes documenting all noteworthy decisions, tasks (with deadline and responsible person), and information communicated, with that record being sent to all participants by end-of-day."[1]

SCRUM:
- 5 point agenda (30 Min, typed during meeting, sent email at end of meeting)
	- Strategic Issue of the week
	- Planned Critical Must Hits of the Week
	- Unplanned Emergencies
	- Daily Sprint
	- Tasks to be accomplished this week (if time)
