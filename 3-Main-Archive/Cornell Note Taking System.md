# Cornell Note Taking System
Status: #Idea

Rough Explanation:
3 Sections of a page, left column is for questions, large column on right is for answers, bottom section is for summary.

It's debated if the questions should be asked first (from reading ahead of time) then answered during lecture or if the lecture should be noted first and then questions formed. But most agree about writing the summary last. 


I could probably implement the cues and answers into my notes system by using a markdown template to create boxes to write in, I wonder if it's worth it.
