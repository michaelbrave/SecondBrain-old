All of my political beliefs hinge on or stem from the idea that everyone has a right to live and a right to exist. I'm not sure if these are guaranteed rights or if they are rights respected by countries (many of their actions say no). But I believe everyone has a right to live and to try to be their best selves and to live unhindered and without persecution by those around, roughly the right to exist, to be.
