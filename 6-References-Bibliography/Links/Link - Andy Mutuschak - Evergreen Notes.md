- Notes are meant to Evolve and accumulate over time, contributing toward something greater
- The Notes themselves don't matter but the insights that they prompt, it's the improved thinking that matters
- Keep a inbox of references and an inbox for scratch notes
- Write about "Everything?" that you read and experience
- Atomic Notes - the smallest measure of unit about one thing
	- this is to better map connections between ideas
	- see also [[Separation of Concerns]] from programming
	- by concept for resilience, longevity and to build up over time
- Should have dense links between them
- has an organic naturally forming non hierarchical structure
- Write for yourself, not an audience
	- these are written to learn from after all, not to show off

I think there is a lot more to learn from him, if I'm willing to go down the rabbit hole and explore his notes
