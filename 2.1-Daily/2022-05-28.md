### Notes Again
looking up better templates and a few other pieces of advice

While looking I found a bunch of old forums on hacker news, and found a lot of side treasures of software and ideas I'd not seen before, many of the threads I read reminded me of things and I filled out some notes that were prompted by those memories. 

What was saddening was how much internet rot I ran into, a lot of it from what I consider fairly recent being only 3-4 years ago. 


### Fantasy World Project
made into a separate repository and obsidian instance. I don't need fantasy terms that I'm defining mixed in with things I actually believe, so I do believe that they should be separated.
