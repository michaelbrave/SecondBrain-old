Today I learned the basics of using [Obsidian] and [Zettelkasten]. 

The gist of it is that you dump all your notes in a folder and then link related things, Obsidian helps by letting you graph and see those relationships. Keyword is [Bi-Directional Linking] meaning making connections between the notes. There are other software that do this but obsidian has plugins, seems to work quite well and is free. 


Notes for future self:
- plugin templater can use .sh scripts to do nearly anything you could do with a command line
- find a way to export/sync plugin settings for one drop on different machines?
- Ctrl-Shift-P to bring up palette/plugin menu
- look up browser extension YiNote to timestamp and take notes on a video
- [Idea - Obsidian Extension For Editable MindMaps] Should create new empty notes or tags to fill in new things created, rename as they are changed, auto link

I also spent a lot of time finishing up reading articles I had open about AI, most of these notes are found in my CompSci education repo, but I will start to transport ideas here later.


[Idea - AI Tutor] - While doing that I had the idea to use [AI] to customize education as a kind of tutor, had the idea before but I think it could track how well you are paying attention, how engaged one is and switch up activities and explanation style as appropriate. Similar to how it's been proven that using things like clickers for checking if the class understood (like micro quizzes but for the teacher to gauge understanding rather than for grading).
